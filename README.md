#Fixed Width Parser to Excel

This Python program reads a fixed-width text file and creates an Excel spreadsheet.

User Story: I have a text file that has rows of undelmitied (fixed-width) data. I need to create an Excel spreadsheet.

There are two parts to the program:

1. fixedwidth_excel_parser.py is the main program.
2. file_specification.py is the configuration file.
